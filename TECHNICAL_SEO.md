# Technical SEO for WebCraft Plaza

This document outlines technical SEO improvements for WebCraft Plaza to ensure that the website is optimized for search engine crawlers.

## Site Speed

*   **Optimize images:** Compress images to reduce file size without sacrificing quality.
*   **Use a caching plugin:** A caching plugin will store a static version of your website, which will reduce the time it takes to load.
*   **Minify CSS and JavaScript files:** Minifying CSS and JavaScript files will remove unnecessary characters and reduce file size.
*   **Use a content delivery network (CDN):** A CDN will store a copy of your website on servers around the world, which will reduce the time it takes to load for visitors from different geographic locations.

## Mobile Optimization

*   Your website is already responsive, which is great. Ensure that all content is easily accessible on mobile devices.
*   Use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test to check your website's mobile-friendliness.

## Structured Data

*   I have already implemented schema markup for your business information.
*   You can also add schema markup for your services, reviews, and blog posts.

## XML Sitemap

*   I have already created an XML sitemap and submitted it to Google Search Console.
*   Make sure to keep your XML sitemap up-to-date as you add new pages to your website.

## Crawlability

*   I have already created a `robots.txt` file.
*   Use a tool like Screaming Frog to crawl your website and find any broken links or other crawlability issues.
